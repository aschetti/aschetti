## My job &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./media/ERS.jpg" width="50" />

I am Coordinator Open Science at [**Erasmus Research Services**](https://www.eur.nl/en/research/research-services), a department within Professional Services at [*Erasmus University Rotterdam*](https://www.eur.nl/en). Among the things I do:

- I develop educational and training materials on Open Science for students, researchers, and support staff
- I support researchers in opening up various stages of their workflow 
- I advise researchers, research teams, and grant officers on how to best highlight commitment to open science in grant applications
- I advise management and policy makers on current and future (inter)national trends related to evaluation procedures at the individual and institutional level

## OSCR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./media/OSCR.jpg" width="50" />

I am founder and former coordinator of the [**Open Science Community Rotterdam**](https://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/) (OSCR), a bottom-up community where researchers and support staff discuss and learn about open research practices.‚Äã OSCR is part of the [**International Network of Open Science & Scholarship Communities**](https://doi.org/10.1093/scipol/scab039) (INOSC), which embraces many communities in the Netherlands and other regions in the world... and we are expanding!

## In my spare time...

I am an independent researcher affiliated with the [**Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education**](https://igdore.org) (IGDORE). I use behavioral tasks and non-invasive electrical brain activity to study emotion, attention, and visual perception. I analyze these complex datasets using a variety of approaches, for example mass univariate analysis of event-related brain potentials and Bayesian multilevel modeling.
